# Display-for-Open-LED-Race
This display uses a 16x16 matrix of WS2812B LEDs. It displays a countdown and then shows the positions of the cars in Open LED Race: Position in the current lap and number of laps completed (right). Each car is represented by its colour. Details of the programme and how it works are given in a blog post.
